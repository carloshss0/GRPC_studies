### Exploring Go language and gRPC.

Considering I have always had more exposure to REST, I wanted to know more about other forms of communication between systems, and gRPC seemed to be a good choice.

In addition to this, I wanted to get exposure to the Go language, I heard many good things about it and decided to get started with some exploration.

So, I explored gRPC, and Go a little using the FullCycle course as a foundation.
